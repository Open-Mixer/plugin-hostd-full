# plugin-hostd-full installed from the channel in a clean Debian or Fedora container, the way the install pages say:
#
#   tools/full-install-check.sh deb|rpm <version> default|headless
#   tools/full-install-check.sh --self-test     the version match below, with no install (make check)
#
# default   apt-get install plugin-hostd-full / dnf install plugin-hostd-full: every package of the stack is installed,
#           omx-panel with it (a Recommends, a weak dependency).
# headless  apt-get install --no-install-recommends / dnf install --setopt=install_weak_deps=False: the same stack with
#           no omx-panel, no X server, no Xlib, Wayland or GTK. Two pulls remain that the panel is not behind, and the
#           check names who pulls them so a new one is red: libxcb (the X protocol client library) only for
#           omx-clap-host, which links it to embed a plugin's window; nodejs only for plugin-qualify and omx-contract
#           (and Debian's node-* modules of nodejs itself).
# Both: plugin-hostd-full is <version> and plugin-hostd is installed at what its range allows (plugin-hostd-full is its
# own repository, released last in each wave: plugin-hostd is a range, never this package's version), and plugin-qualification-records is the build of this machine's architecture,
# holding the sets of its class (rpi5 on arm64/aarch64, x86-64 on amd64/x86_64). The channel must already be configured (add-openmixer); Pages
# serves a fresh publish a little late, so the install is retried before it is called broken.
set -euo pipefail
# <version> as the package manager shows it: the version itself, or it with a Debian revision, an RPM release or a
